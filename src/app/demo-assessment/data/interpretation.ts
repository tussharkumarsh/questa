        "interpretation": "You lead with energy and drive. You're quick to step in, take charge, and get things moving. Once you are in an action mode, you step back to analyze and make sense of things, tuning into your thoughts and strategy. Emotion comes last—felt deeply, but often privately.",
        "suspenseStatement": "Curious to know what drives your instinctive moves? Let’s uncover it together."

        "interpretation": "You’re instinctively hands-on and warm. You move fast, but not without tuning into others—relationships matter deeply. You check the emotional temperature of a room before sorting through the logic of it all.",
        "suspenseStatement": "But does your empathy fuel your strategy... or cloud it? There’s more to explore."
    },
    "213": {
        "interpretation": "You’re a planner and strategist. You analyze situations, make informed choices, and then act with precision. Emotions get parked in the backseat—but they’re still along for the ride.",
        "suspenseStatement": "But how much do your emotions shape your “rational” choices? Let’s find out."

    "231": {
        "interpretation": "You process the world from the inside out—first mentally, then emotionally. You reflect deeply before making a move, and your actions are thoughtful and values-driven.",

    },
    "312": {
        "interpretation": "You wear your heart openly, and it drives you forward. Your gut response is to act from what you care about—your passions, your people, your principles. The analysis comes later, once things are already in motion.",
        "suspenseStatement": "But what role does logic play in your decisions? The answer is more complex than you think."
    },
    "321": {
        "interpretation": "Empathy is your starting point. You sense what’s going on emotionally, then think through the meaning and implications. Only once you’ve felt and thought it through do you step into action.",
        "suspenseStatement": "But what happens when emotions and logic pull in opposite directions? Your assessment may reveal the key."
